### Note:

## what is oni?
The Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) is one of the primary indices used to monitor the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The ONI is calculated by averaging sea surface temperature anomalies in an area of the east-central equatorial Pacific Ocean, which is called the Nino-3.4 region (5S to 5N; 170W to 120W). Also, a 3-month time average (running mean) is calculated in order to better isolate variability closely related to the ENSO phenomenon.
