### Note:
I used 'oni' to identify the type of year or month as el Nino, la Nina, or neutral. 
* oni value greater than 0.4 is considered as el Nino
* oni value between -0.4 and 0.4 is considered as neutral
* oni value less than -0.4 is considered as la Nina

#### what is oni?
The Oceanic Nino Index (ONI) is one of the primary indices used to monitor the El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO). The ONI is calculated by averaging sea surface temperature anomalies in an area of the east-central equatorial Pacific Ocean, which is called the Nino-3.4 region (5S to 5N; 170W to 120W). Also, a 3-month time average (running mean) is calculated in order to better isolate variability closely related to the ENSO phenomenon.
