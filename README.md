# elNino_laNina_natural_disasters_US
Galvanize Data Analytics class: final project

This is a final project to demonstrate my SQL skills using datasets related to el Nino, la Nina, and natural disasters in US from 1980 to 2017. These datasets are publicly available: [link 1](http://origin.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/ensostuff/ONI_v5.php), [link 2](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/events/US/1980-2018), [link 3](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/billions/time-series), [link 4](https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/societal-impacts/wildfires/ytd/0?params[]=acres&params[]=fires).

### Create Table and Data Import
* [Loading in Data] (https://github.com/nitroamy/elNino_laNina_natural_disasters_US/tree/master/create_table_load_data)
* [CSV files] (https://github.com/nitroamy/elNino_laNina_natural_disasters_US/tree/master/create_table_load_data/CSV%20Files)

### SQL Queries
* Identifying year/month as el Nino, la Nina, or Neutral: DISTINCT, AVG, CASE, ORDER BY
* Joining Tables: INNER JOIN, LEFT OUTER JOIN, WHERE
* SUM, COUNT, LIKE, HAVING, Subqueries, UNION, WITH AS, EXCEPT

### Excel Data Presentation
* LOOKUP
* Pivot Table

### Visualizations

### A note on the data
I did need to make a few changes to the downloaded dataset in order to properly load
