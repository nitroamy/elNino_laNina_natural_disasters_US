  * TEXT function to format Begin and End Date from mm/dd/yy to mm/yyyy
  * VLOOKUP to identify type of month. The formatted Date was used as lookup value and data table from year_month_type worksheet was used as table array.
  * IF function to evaluate whether Begin Date and End Date have the same month type; I set the return value as yes if statement is true and no if statement is false.
